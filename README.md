# Go Feijoada

Go Feijoada it's not me asking you to try one of my favorite dishes in the Brazilian cuisine. It's a study over a few
things I've been professionally working with in the last years, all mixed together in a chaotic but planned ~~recipe~~
architecture to showcase what can be done with such ~~ingredients~~ products, services, go modules and so on.
