# Go Feijoada

## What is it?
Go Feijoada it's not me asking you to try one of my favorite dishes in the Brazilian cuisine. It's a study over a few
things I've been professionally working with in the last years, all mixed together in a chaotic but planned ~~recipe~~
architecture to showcase what can be done with such ~~ingredients~~ products, services, go modules and so on.

## What you can find here:

More details are available in each project READMEs.

- **[schema-repository](./schema-repository)**:
   - Webservice using Gin
   - Custom request binding validation
   - Custom request struct unmarshalling
   - Configurable by file or environment variables
   - Redis or Valkey for persistence

## Other thoughts:

- The modules are in the same repository for a reason: this is a study, an experience, an example. I didn't want it to
  be scattered because they don't mean much separated.
